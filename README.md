## Usage 

1. Install Pytorch and necessary dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. The datasets can be obtained from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l51QsKvQPcqILT3DwfjCgx8Dsg2rpjot/view?usp=drive_link) or [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11AWXg1Z6UwjHzmto4hesAA?pwd=9qjr).
2. Please create a folder named "data" and put the dataset into it.
3. Train and evaluate the model. We provide all the above tasks under the folder ./scripts/. You can reproduce the results as the following examples:

```
# Multivariate forecasting with MA-Mixer
bash ./scripts/multivariate_forecasting/SolarEnergy/MA_Mixer.sh

```
